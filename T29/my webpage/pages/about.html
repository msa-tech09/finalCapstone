        <h2>Club History</h2>
        <div class="para-history">
          <p>Manchester United Football Club is a professional football club based in Manchester, England, that
            competes
            in the Premier League, the top flight of English football. </p>
          <p>Manchester United was formed in 1878 as Newton Heath LYR Football Club by the Carriage and Wagon
            department
            of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway depot at Newton Heath. In 1902, the club was renamed Manchester
            United, and in 1910, they moved to Old Trafford, their current home ground.</p>
          <p>Manchester United have won a record 20 League titles, 12 FA Cups, five League Cups, and a record 21 FA
            Community
            Shields. They have won the European Cup/UEFA Champions League three times, and the UEFA Europa League, the
            UEFA Cup
            Winners' Cup, the UEFA Super Cup, the Intercontinental Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup once each. In 1968,
            under
            the management of Matt Busby, 10 years after eight of the club's players were killed in the Munich air
            disaster, they
            became the first English club to win the European Cup. Alex Ferguson is the club's longest-serving and
            most
            successful
            manager, winning 38 trophies, including 13 league titles, five FA Cups, and two Champions League titles
            between 1986 and
            2013.</p>
          <p>In the 1998–99 season, under Ferguson, the club became the first in the history of English football to
            achieve the European treble of the Premier League, FA Cup, and UEFA Champions League.[9] In winning the
            UEFA
            Europa
            League under José Mourinho in 2016–17, they became one of five clubs to have won the original three main
            UEFA club
            competitions (the Champions League, Europa League and Cup Winners' Cup).</p>
